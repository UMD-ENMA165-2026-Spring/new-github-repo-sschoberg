# Repo Set Up
* Visibility: I chose my repository to be public because I like the idea of "Open Source" and promoting communities to build upon one another's ideas
* README: I chose to add a README because it is good practice to get into the habit of creating them
* License: I chose a MIT license because of its legal simplicity, and it was very easy to understand
